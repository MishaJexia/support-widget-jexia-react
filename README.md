![Client](screenshot/screenshot_1.png)

## What do you need
Pro project on Jexia.com
Modules: DataSet, Real-time communication, Project Users.  

## Running the demo

To run the demo first setup Jexia project:

1. We need to have dataset with name clients. You can use schemaless approach and do not create fields. I did it to have some basic validations and default values. In this dataset we will keep sessions which was open. ![clients dataset](screenshot/project_ds.png)
2. We need to have another dataset with name chat to keep chat history between client and agent ![chat dataset](screenshot/project_chat.png)
3. Create 1 project user for Agent ![chat dataset](screenshot/ums.png)
4. Create API key / secret which we will put into `client/src/jexia.js` ![chat dataset](screenshot/api_key.png)
5. Setup policy for API, we need access for clients and chat dataset - Read, Create. ![chat dataset](screenshot/policy.png)
6. `cd client && npm install`
7. `npm run start`

## How it works:
1. All Jexia initialization happned in `jexia.js`. We started and expose needed models of Jexia. Keep in mind UMS and Real-time it is a **pro** services. 
2. In Client.js you can find all functiones related to widget
3. In Agent.js all features related to `/admin`, which is agent area. 
4. We use 1 pre-defined agent in `Agent.js` which is created in Project user (point 3 above).
